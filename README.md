# Machine Learning Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning practice projects. Each project folder focuses on a specific machine learning concept, with a dataset and a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file that demonstrates the concept in practice.

## Folder Structure

Each folder corresponds to a machine learning concept, with the following structure:
- A dataset file (e.g., `.csv`).
- A Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) that walks through the implementation of the machine learning technique.
