# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning concepts, each presented with its own dataset and a corresponding Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) file. The purpose of this folder is to demonstrate the application of various machine learning algorithms and techniques on real-world datasets.

## Folder Structure

Each subfolder corresponds to a specific machine learning concept or technique. Within each subfolder, you will find:
- A dataset file (`.csv`).
- A Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) that explains and demonstrates the application of the machine learning concept on the dataset.

## Concepts Covered

- **Linear Regression:** A regression algorithm that models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
- **Logistic Regression:** A classification algorithm used when the dependent variable is categorical.
- **Decision Trees:** A non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** A supervised learning model used for classification and regression tasks.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** A simple, instance-based learning algorithm used for both classification and regression.
- **Random Forest:** An ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them to improve performance.
- **K-Means Clustering:** An unsupervised algorithm that partitions data into clusters based on feature similarity.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** A dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional data into fewer dimensions while retaining the most important information.

## How to Run the Notebooks

To run the Jupyter Notebooks, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
